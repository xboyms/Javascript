        <h1>Education 📚</h1>
        <p>
            In 2022, I applied to study a BSc in digital media production at Umeå University. I was introduced to UX
            design early on and I
            knew it was something I wanted to pursue. I learned to design with
            purpose, and fulfill actual need.
        </p>
        <p>
            Later, I decided to study a MSc in HCI & UX to gain a deeper understanding of
            interaction design. I knew I wanted to challenge myself so I took part in a robot competition where
            myself, together with 2 classmates, built a robot from scratch.
            I also managed to land a summer internship as a UX designer at Nasdaq. Additionally, I applied to study
            some programming courses as I became more interested in designing and building products from scratch.
        </p>
        <p>
            After five years at Umeå University I graduated with two degrees:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>BSc in Digital Media Production</li>
            <li>MSc in Human Computer Interaction & User Experience</li>

        </ul>

                I grew up playing video games and was always interested in tech and operating systems. In secondary
                school
                I decided to study IT and learn programming. After graduating I realized that my interest lied in the
                interaction between human and technology. During the first semester of pursuing a higher education, I
                stumbled upon the term UX design and I realized the impact it had on shaping contemporary technology.

                Apart from studying, I train and compete in CrossFit and Olympic weightlifting. 🏋️‍♂️
